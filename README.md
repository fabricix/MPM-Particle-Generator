# MPM-Generator
Particle generator for the MPM developed at Civil Engineering Department of Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.

The generator allows to create numerical MPM models based on the contour lines of the land. It has three main characteristics: 
  - the construction of the MPM discrete model is based only on raster digital elevation model (DEM) data
  - finite element meshes are not required
  - the heterogeneities are defined by the DEM data of each material
